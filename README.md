# Expression decorator demo

Demo for `@expression`, target to verify whether it is doable.

Currently implement an init version, which:

- convert expression into object which records statments, and it can be merged
- (limitation) only support one line lambda function
- (need to refine) naive parse method for function code (may need AST library to do that in robust way)
